## What is this?
This is a Jupyter Notebook of different prediction models that can be used to try and predict stock prices based on various technical indicators, such as historical performance, moving averages and volume. New scripts/models will be added over time as I learn how to use different tools and libraries.

## Why?
As my experience with financial data analytics and development progressed through my co-op terms, I realized that much of my work has revovled around the usage of data that already existed, and the development of applciations around it. With that, I wanted to learn something new, but familiar enough that I would continue to be interested in it, and decided to pick up on the development of some prediction models. 

## What's next?
I hope to continue to expand my skills, and this repository, to include any new models and technologies that I may learn. One thing I want to focus on is the use of deep-learning modules to try and predict the future prices of equities. This would include the use of the TensorFlow library, and is something I have started with, as seen with the LSTM model.

## Current models
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regression

# Ongoing:
* LSTM model with Keras
